i am developing this program to control the flight controller of a quad copter. i currently don't have any hardware for the copter but will most likely run this program from a dev board and interface with the copter flight controller through an adc. i will probably use the mpc3008 adc. i plan on using either ultrasonic or ir sensors for proximity. once i make some progress i also plan to include gps.

this is just the beginning of a project i have been thinking about for quite a while. if you stumble across this project 
and want to contribute either ideas or critques please feel free....

thank you
